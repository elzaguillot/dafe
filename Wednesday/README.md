# Wednesday Session

### Machine Learning Tutorial

This session will introduce some supervised learning concepts and Neural Networks.
There are three Notebooks that should be worked through in order.

1. Perceptrons - The building blocks of Neural Networks and introduction to decision boundaries.

2. Neural Network - Neural Network for the Iris dataset. Activation functions, Backpropagation and training/test data.

3. Iris Keras - Introduction to the Keras API for machine learning.
